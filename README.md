The knowledge applied to this project are as follows:
1. HTML:
    - HTML boilerplate
2. JavaScript:
    - Variables
    - Numbers and strings
    - Conditionals
    - Operations
    - Functions and return values
    - Understanding errors
    - Use of Chrome DevTools
    - Arrays
    - Loops (prior to DOM Manipulation and Events refactor)
